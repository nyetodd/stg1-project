        <h2>WHO ARE THE BANDS?</h2>
        <p>
          Baltimore's <span class="title">WILDHONEY</span> have been making music together since 2011, forging a fresh sound from raw materials of shoegaze, punk and good old indiepop.
        </p>
        <p>
          East London's <span class="title">TIGERCATS</span> jangly, effervescent pop nods to their punk roots and spikes the pop punch with anthemic choruses and massive, crunching guitars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philadelphia's <span class="title">MERCURY GIRLS</span> are one of the most talked-about new bands in ages. Featuring members of <span class="title">Literature, Little Big League and Pet Milk</span>, Mercury Girls have a gorgeous, layered sound that combines post-punk dynamics with soaring/jangling guitars, fantastic melodies and expertly-arranged tunes.
        <p>
        <p>
          Edinburgh, Scotland's <span class="title">THE SPOOK SCHOOL</span> are surely the most fun band taking-on issues of gender and identity today, writing queer-pop anthems that are noisy, tuneful, sharply-observed and outrageously catchy.

              <p>Continental Drift offers a collection of songs to make your heart soar and your feet move, like all the best pop music should, and the sheer number of ideas contained in its 8 track, half-hour duration is testament to the way the labels and bands have responded to their self-imposed challenge.</p>
